class: center, middle

# Responsive
# Scalable

???
- High level goals
- Everyone: Responsive even for low throughput
- Scalable for those who need it
- Scalable in process: Execution model appropriate
- Scalable across machines
- Resource efficiency

---

class: center, middle

# Asynchronous
# Back pressured

???
- Techniques to achieve the goals
- Different/better techniques?
- Async
  - Remaining responsive
- Back pressure/FlowControl
  - Dealing with components that run at different speeds
  - Much more important when moving away from thread per request

---
# Goals

* High level
  * What does async give us?
  * What does flow control give us?
* Concrete tech
  * Flow control with Akka streams
* Demos
  * TCP Client -> TCP Server (slow server)
  * Http Client -> TCP -> Http Server -> TCP -> Apache Cassandra (slow client)

???
- Takeaways for this presentation
- Flow control in your application and between them
- TCP windowing, receive and send buffers, akka streams
- Big point: If the client slows down we stop fetching results
  from the database. No wasted effort. Constant memory footprint

---
# Use case
* HTTP Service, endpoints for:
  * User information from database
  * Getting user activity over a large time span
--

* Requirements
  * Respond in a timely manner, even if it is a failure
  * Don't do any unnecessary work
  * Constant memory footprint

???
-

---
class: center, middle
# Responsive

???
- Single request


---
# Responsiveness
* Control over when your application responds
  * Service time vs response time
  * Queues and buffers
* Dependencies
  * Don't make their problem your problem

<br/>
<br/>

.center[![queue](response-time.png)]

???
- Response time vs service time
- Yellow is service time
- Red is response time


---
class: center, middle
# Execution models

???
- How does a byte get some the wire to your code?
- What threads are used?
- Single threaded?
- Thread per request?
- Thread per core without blocking IO?
- How to get this wrong even with the right tools?


---
# Thread per request


```scala
def post(request: HttpRequest): HttpResponse = {
  // do something very important
  ???
}
```

???
- Options for this API?
- Hystrix

---
# Thread per request

```scala
def post(request: HttpRequest): HttpResponse = {
   val userId = request.getQueryParam("userId")
   val user: User = getUserFromDatabase(userId)

   ExternalService.sendPresentToUser(user)

   HttpResponse(200)
 }
```

???
- Giving up the thread of control

---

# Thread per request

```scala
def post(request: HttpRequest): HttpResponse = {
   // nice and quick
   val userId = request.getQueryParam("userId")
   // 5 millis to 10 seconds?
   val user: User = getUserFromDatabase(userId)

   // 5 milliss to 10 seconds?
   ExternalService.sendPresentToUser(user)

   HttpResponse(200)
 }
```

???
- Pros: very simple programming model
- Socket read timeouts?
- "back pressure" via max number of threads

---
# Demonstrating this

```
http://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6520-think-your-software-is-fault-tolerant-prove-it
```

???
- Demonstrates network level timeouts don't work for SLAs

---
# Async


```scala
def request(request: HttpRequest): Future[HttpResponse] = ???
```

* Timeout independent to dependency times
* Option not to block on IO
* Works well for small responses that are ready to go

???
-


---
# Async


```scala
def request(request: HttpRequest): Future[HttpResponse] =
  for {
    user <- lookupUser(request.getQueryParam("userId"))
    _ <- AsyncExternalService.sendPresentToUser(user)
  } yield HttpResponse(200)
```

???
- Dependencies to be async as well
- Benefits even if all deps aren't async

---
# Akka HTTP

```scala
path("user" / Segment) { name =>
  get {
    val user: Future[Option[User]] = DataAccess.lookupUser(name)
    onComplete(user) {
      case Success(Some(u)) => complete(u)
      case Success(None)    => complete(NotFound)
      case Failure(t)       => complete(InternalServerError, t.getMessage)
    }
}
```

???
- Routing DSL
- Lower level API
- Can complete with: value, future, stream
- Need a way to serialise User

---
# Database

```scala
val session = ... // From the Cassandra driver
```

```scala
def lookupUser(userId: UserId): Future[Option[User]] = {
   session.executeAsync("select * from users where user_id = ?", userId).asScala
     .map((rs: ResultSet) => Option(rs.one())
     .map(row => User(
         row.getString("user_id"),
         row.getString("user_name"),
         row.getInt("age"))))
}
```

???
- Async now all the way through
- How do we do a request timeout now?

---
# Akka HTTP


```scala
path("user" / Segment) { name =>
  get {
    withRequestTimeout(500.millis) {
      val user: Future[Option[User]] = DataAccess.lookupUser(name)
      onComplete(user) {
        case Success(Some(u)) => complete(u)
        case Success(None)    => complete(NotFound)
        case Failure(t)       => complete(InternalServerError, t.getMessage)
      }
    }
}
```

???
- Surrounding with a directive

---
class: centre, middle
#  Responsiveness under load

???
- Now assume a large request or a large number of requests
- How to handle?

---
# Playing fair

```

???
- How do we stop the server overloading the service?
- How do we handle the client consuming our response slowly?
- We'll demo this with HTTP / Apache Cassandra

---
# The default

.center[![queue](toomuchmail.jpg)]

---
# Queueing and/or buffering

* How would this work if Kafka was between the services?

<br/>
<br/>
--
.center[![queue](pubsub-half.png)]

???
- Evenly matches the queue would go up and down

---
# Fast publisher

* Without the queue:
  * Down stream gets overwhelmed
  * Publisher has wasted resources

<br/>
<br/>

--
.center[![queue](pubsub-full.png)]
--

<br/>
<br/>
* Would this work in memory?
* Why produce data no one is ready to consume?

???
- How many of your applications deal with the queue filling up and
  send back back pressure?

---
# Reacting to failure
* Is the consumer slow or down?
* Circuit breakers

<br/>
<br/>
.center[![Circuit breaker](circuit-breaker.png)]


???

- Circuit breakers
- Static throttling?
- Hystrix
- Not acceptable to react, we should prevent!

---
# Flow control

* Dynamically adjust the rate based on demand

<br/>
<br/>
.center[![queue](demand.png)]

???
- Scenarios
  - HTTP to database
  - Kafka to Cassandra
  - Reactive streams
- Subscriber dictates flow, keeping publisher aware of its
  free buffer space

---
# TCP flow control

* Only send data that the other side is expected to handle

???
- How how works
- How to build this into your application


---
# TCP windowing

# TCP windowing

---
# TCP windowing

???
- Window fills up, client stops sending
- Heart beats to know when it can start sending again

# Akka Streams 101

* Sources
  * Emit elements
    * Iterables
    * Files
    * TCP connections
    * Kafka

* Sinks
  * Sends data some where or side effects
    * Side effects
    * Databases
    * TCP connections

# Demo summary

* TCP slow server
  * TCP buffers fill up
  * Client stop doing work
--

* HTTP slow client
  * Client makes request for a large payload
  * TCP buffers fill up
  * Server *stops* getting data from database
  * Client then demands more
  * Everything starts flowing

---
# Summary
* Flow control can flow through the network into your app
  * Prevent your applications from being overloaded
  * Save CPU cycles
--

* Akka streams is one way to do it in your application
--

* Take advantage of TCP's flow control

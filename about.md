As a software engineer of over 12 years I have worked with countless programming languages
and technologies. I specialise in what are traditionally multiple distinct roles:

* Platform engineer
* Site Reliability Engineer
* Backend engineer
* Engineering Manager
* Technical Lead
* Chief Technology Officer

As an engineer I've deployed 100s of JVM services to production. 

I've also worked as a Platform Engineer and SRE, having deployed Kubernetes to production starting 
with version 0.8.

Knowledge in these two areas allow me to work on the design and implementation of full systems, from 
the infrastructure, database selection, all the way to tuning the application in production.

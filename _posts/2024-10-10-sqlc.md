## Introduction

Go developers face challenges with database interactions. ORMs offer convenience but sacrifice control. Raw SQL provides control but lacks safety. `pgx/v5` and sqlc bridge this gap.

`pgx/v5` acts as a PostgreSQL driver. It offers high performance and low-level control. sqlc generates Go code from SQL queries. It provides type safety and IDE support.

This combination allows you to write efficient, type-safe database code in Go.

## Why Use Raw SQL?

Raw SQL gives you direct control over database operations.

Benefits include:

- **Performance:** Write optimized queries for your specific use cases
- **Control:** Use all features of your database system
- **Visibility:** See exactly what queries run in your code
- **Learning:** Improve your SQL skills through practice
- **Optimization:** Directly address performance issues in queries

Raw SQL shines in complex scenarios. It allows fine-tuning of database interactions.

## Getting Started with `pgx/v5`

`pgx/v5` serves as a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. It offers features beyond a basic driver.

### Installation

`pgx/v5` installs easily with Go's package manager. It integrates smoothly into Go projects.

Install `pgx/v5`:

```
go get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5
```

Import it:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5"
)
```

### Database Connections

`pgx/v5` simplifies database connections. It handles connection pooling and management. This allows your application to use database resources efficiently.

Connect to PostgreSQL:

```go
connString := "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), connString)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Unable to connect to database: %v\n", err)
    os.Exit(1)
}
defer conn.Close(context.Background())
```

### Query Execution

With `pgx/v5`, you execute SQL queries directly. This gives you full control over your database interactions. You can run SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations with ease.

Execute a query:

```go
rows, err := conn.Query(context.Background(), "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = true")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Query failed: %v\n", err)
    return
}
defer rows.Close()

for rows.Next() {
    var id int
    var name string
    err = rows.Scan(&id, &name)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Scan failed: %v\n", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Printf("User: %d %s\n", id, name)
}
```

## Advanced `pgx/v5` Features

`pgx/v5` offers advanced features for complex database operations.

### Prepared Statements

Prepared statements improve performance for repeated queries. They also protect against SQL injection attacks.

Use prepared statements for repeated queries:

```go
stmt, err := conn.Prepare(context.Background(), "getUserByID", "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = $1")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Unable to prepare statement: %v\n", err)
    return
}

row := conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), "getUserByID", 1)

var id int
var name, email string
err = row.Scan(&id, &name, &email)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Query failed: %v\n", err)
    return
}
```

### Transactions

Transactions ensure data consistency. They allow you to group multiple operations. These operations succeed or fail as a unit.

Ensure data integrity with transactions:

```go
tx, err := conn.Begin(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Unable to start transaction: %v\n", err)
    return
}
defer tx.Rollback(context.Background())

_, err = tx.Exec(context.Background(), "INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)", 1, 100, 2)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Failed to insert order: %v\n", err)
    return
}

_, err = tx.Exec(context.Background(), "UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - $1 WHERE product_id = $2", 2, 100)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Failed to update inventory: %v\n", err)
    return
}

err = tx.Commit(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Failed to commit transaction: %v\n", err)
    return
}
```

### Batch Operations

Batch operations reduce network round trips. They allow you to send multiple queries in one request. This improves performance for multiple related operations.

Execute multiple queries in one round-trip:

```go
batch := &pgx.Batch{}
batch.Queue("INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ($1)", "Log message 1")
batch.Queue("INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES ($1)", "Log message 2")
batch.Queue("SELECT count(*) FROM logs")

results := conn.SendBatch(context.Background(), batch)

for i := 0; i < batch.Len(); i++ {
    _, err := results.Exec()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error executing batch operation %d: %v\n", i, err)
    }
}

var count int
err := results.QueryRow().Scan(&count)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error scanning result: %v\n", err)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("Total log count: %d\n", count)
}

err = results.Close()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error closing batch: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Null Handling

`pgx/v5` provides robust null handling. It offers types that distinguish between null and zero values. This prevents errors from null database fields.

Handle NULL values with pgx types:

```go
import (
    "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgtype"
)

var id int
var name string
var email pgtype.Text

err := conn.QueryRow(context.Background(), "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = $1", 1).Scan(&id, &name, &email)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Query failed: %v\n", err)
    return
}

fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Name: %s\n", id, name)
if email.Valid {
    fmt.Printf("Email: %s\n", email.String)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Email: NULL")
}
```

## Introducing sqlc

sqlc generates Go code from SQL queries. It combines the control of raw SQL with the safety of generated code.

### Benefits of sqlc

sqlc offers several advantages:

- **Type Safety:** Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **IDE Support:** Get autocomplete and refactoring for database code
- **Performance:** Avoid runtime reflection and query building
- **SQL First:** Write standard SQL, use all database features

### Installation

sqlc installs as a command-line tool. It integrates into your development workflow.

Install sqlc:

```
go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest
```

Create a configuration file `sqlc.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "2"
sql:
  - engine: "postgresql"
    queries: "./sql/queries/"
    schema: "./sql/schema/"
    gen:
      go:
        package: "database"
        out: "./database"
        emit_prepared_queries: true
        emit_interface: true
        emit_exact_table_names: false
```

## Writing Queries with sqlc

sqlc uses SQL files to generate Go code.

You write schema files to define your database structure. Query files contain the SQL queries you want to execute.

sqlc reads these files and generates corresponding Go functions. These functions are type-safe and easy to use in your Go code.

Create SQL files for schema and queries.

Schema file `./sql/schema/users.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Query file `./sql/queries/users.sql`:

```sql
-- name: GetUser :one
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = $1 LIMIT 1;

-- name: ListUsers :many
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY name;

-- name: CreateUser :one
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ($1, $2)
RETURNING *;

-- name: UpdateUser :one
UPDATE users
SET name = $2, email = $3
WHERE id = $1
RETURNING *;

-- name: DeleteUser :exec
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = $1;
```

Generate Go code:

```
sqlc generate
```

Use generated code:

```go
conn, err := pgx.Connect(context.Background(), "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close(context.Background())

queries := database.New(conn)

user, err := queries.CreateUser(context.Background(), database.CreateUserParams{
    Name:  "John Doe",
    Email: "john@example.com",
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Created user: %+v\n", user)

users, err := queries.ListUsers(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

for _, u := range users {
    fmt.Printf("User: %s (%s)\n", u.Name, u.Email)
}
```

## Best Practices

Effective database operations require good practices.

Key practices include:

- Error handling: Always check and handle errors from database operations
- Query organization: Group related queries logically
- Prepared statements: Use for frequently executed queries
- Batch operations: Group related operations to reduce network traffic
- Indexing: Create appropriate indexes based on your query patterns
- Pagination: Use LIMIT and OFFSET for large datasets
- Query analysis: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand and optimize query performance

## Comparison with ORMs

Raw SQL with `pgx/v5` and sqlc offers advantages in specific scenarios.

It works well for:

- Performance-critical applications
- Complex queries
- Using database-specific features
- Teams with strong SQL skills

ORMs might be preferable for:

- Smaller projects with simple database needs
- Rapid development scenarios
- Teams more comfortable with OOP than SQL
- Projects requiring support for multiple database types

Consider your project's specific needs when choosing between these approaches.

## Conclusion

`pgx/v5` and sqlc offer a powerful combination for Go database operations. They provide the control of raw SQL with the safety of generated code.

This approach requires more initial setup than ORMs. However, it offers long-term benefits for complex projects. It allows fine-grained control over database interactions while maintaining type safety.

Consider your project requirements when deciding between raw SQL and ORMs. Each approach has its place in Go development.
